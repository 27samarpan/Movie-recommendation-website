It is a type of recommendation system which works on the principle of similar content. It will check for other movies of similar content or the same genre of the movie the user is watching. There are various fundamentals attributes that are used to compute the similarity while checking about similar content.

IMPLEMENTATION: It is implemented by using nearest neighbour algorithm with cosine similarity

Cosine Similarity: Cosine of the angle between the two vectors of the item, vectors of A and B is calculated for imputing similarity. If the vectors are closer, then small will be the angle and large will be the cosine.
